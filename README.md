# After Effects Scripts

A collection of helpful workflow scripts for After Effects that either run natively right from the After Effects menu or partner well with 3rd party tools from [aescripts + aeplugins](https://aescripts.com/) such as [KBar3](https://aescripts.com/kbar/), [Tool Launcher](https://aescripts.com/tool-launcher/), [Quick Menu 3](https://aescripts.com/quick-menu/).

I also have a free tool for After Effects called [Atheneum](https://github.com/kyletmartinez/atheneum-for-after-effects) which I personally use with this script collection.

To run a script natively in After Effects use `File > Script > Run Script File...` and choose the script.

## Download Entire Collection

From the front page, click the green `Code` button and then click `Download ZIP.` From there, you can unzip the file and choose any script file you want.

## Usage & Support

Please keep in mind these scripts are provided as-is. They're written specifially to support my setup and After Effects workflow so they don't include extensive error handling or validation.

Please review each script before using it to ensure it fits your workflow and file struture.

While I'm more than happy to share these tools with the animation community, I'm unable to provide support or guarantee compatibility with all After Effects configurations. Feel free to fork and modify them to suit your needs!
