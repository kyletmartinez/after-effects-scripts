# After Effects Project Scripts

These scripts were developed in a very _specific way_ for an _incredibly niche_ use on a _very distinct_ project. The scripts by themselves, with no context, are probably completely useless. However...

- I needed so save the scripts somewhere so this makes the most sense.
- There are a lot of fun and interesting snippets here that can easily be repurposed for other projects.

Enjoy!
