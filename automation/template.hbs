# After Effects Scripts

A collection of helpful workflow scripts for After Effects that either run natively right from the After Effects menu or partner well with 3rd party tools from [aescripts + aeplugins](https://aescripts.com/) such as [KBar3](https://aescripts.com/kbar/), [Tool Launcher](https://aescripts.com/tool-launcher/), [Quick Menu 3](https://aescripts.com/quick-menu/).

I also have a free tool for After Effects called [Atheneum](https://github.com/kyletmartinez/atheneum-for-after-effects) which I personally use with this script collection.

To run a script natively in After Effects use `File > Script > Run Script File...` and choose the script.

> [!TIP]
> All scripts can be found within the [source/scripts](/source/scripts) folder.

## Download Entire Collection

From the front page, click the green `Code` button and then click `Download ZIP.` From there, you can unzip the file and choose any script file you want.

## Download Single Script

From a script page, click the `Download raw file` near the upper right of code window.
