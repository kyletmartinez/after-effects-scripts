# After Effects Scripts

A collection of helpful workflow scripts for After Effects that either run natively right from the After Effects menu or partner well with 3rd party tools from [aescripts + aeplugins](https://aescripts.com/) such as [KBar3](https://aescripts.com/kbar/), [Tool Launcher](https://aescripts.com/tool-launcher/), [Quick Menu 3](https://aescripts.com/quick-menu/).

I also have a free tool for After Effects called [Atheneum](https://github.com/kyletmartinez/atheneum-for-after-effects) which I personally use with this script collection.

To run a script natively in After Effects use `File > Script > Run Script File...` and choose the script.
